# Weather-Forecaster
This is a weather forecasting website, that asks for your location first and presents the weather for next 7 days. It basically gathers the coordinates of your location (Longitude and latitude) and using that it finds out the time zone of your location. It uses an API and produces additional details like humidity, wind speed, Sun rise, Sun set etc.

This was my first Hackathon project.
